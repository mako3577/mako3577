Amateur programmer with high aspirations. My goal is to improve my skills to level, which will make me able to succesfuly apply for first IT job.
To achieve it i've started some online courses including Tim Buchalka's "Learn Python Programming Masterclass", which helped me a lot to write my own functions 
or simple programs using clean, easy-to-read code.

For now I'm focused on improving Python skills to achieve titular "masterclass" level :)
I also learn english. Even if all I wrote is probably understandable, I'm determinated to learn speaking and writing in this langueage more fluent.


I'll be gratefull for any feedback.

My goal is to constantly improve my skills to become expert fullstack web developer. First step to achieve it was Tim Buchalka's "Learn Python Programming Masterclass" online course, which teached me what actually programming is, how it works and what programming languages can be used for.

However, after I've finished this course, I became interested in web development. To satisfy my curiosity I've started to learn HTML and CSS from Jonas Schmedtmann course "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS". 
Now I feel comfortable when writing my own HTML and CSS clean code from scratch and I am also able to understand someones else code.

For now I work on my web projects to pratice HTML/CSS/JS skills.

HTML / CSS / Python3 / JavaScript / SQL
